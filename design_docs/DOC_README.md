## Working Principles for AI Assistants

These principles apply to AI-assisted work on this project. Update this
section whenever a durable working insight emerges from a session.

- **Theory model is owned**: do not depend on `rust-music-theory` or
  similar upstream theory crates. We need exotic scales, non-tertiary
  chords, and arbitrary tunings; the upstream models do not support
  those, and inheriting their data shape costs more than it saves. Build
  the theory crate from scratch.
- **Pure core, thin shell**: `crates/woodshedding` must remain pure data
  + math — no I/O, no UI, no audio. The app crate consumes it.
- **Desktop first, mobile later**: ship to itch.io / Gumroad for desktop
  before attempting mobile. Iced mobile support is the eventual path;
  contributing to it is part of the project's broader value but does not
  block the music app.
- **Generalize across stringed instruments**: theory model parameterizes
  string count and tuning so bass, ukulele, and banjo fall out for free.
  Do not hard-code 6-string assumptions.
- **Catalog and generators are complementary, not redundant**: the
  catalog answers "what are the well-known tunings?" (preserves cultural
  names, voicing conventions, history); generators answer "what does
  this tuning become under transformation?" (transpose, drop a string,
  apply an interval pattern). The same pattern will apply to scales and
  chords: named-scale catalog + apply-formula-to-root algorithm. Don't
  pick one over the other — they answer different questions.
